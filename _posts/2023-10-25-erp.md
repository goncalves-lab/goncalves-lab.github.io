[Supplementary Table 1](https://goncalves-lab.github.io/ERP/) with information on placental mammalian species and their potential to reach end of reproduction. The table contains information on whether species reached the end of their reproductive potential, what percentage of life is spent in acyclicity, which method was used to assess it, the number of replicates used and links to the original study. Column ‘n’ indicates the number of individuals in the last 20% of their lifespan. The total number of individuals is shown in brackets. Only studies with primary data were included. Species which did not have at least 10 individuals within 20% of their lifespan were excluded.
