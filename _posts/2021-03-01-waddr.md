## Description
![image]({{ page.img | relative_url }}){: width="130" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"} The <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/waddR.html">R/Bioconductor waddR package</a> offers statistical tests based on the 2-Wasserstein distance for detecting and characterizing differences between two distributions given in the form of samples. Functions for calculating the 2-Wasserstein distance and testing for differential distributions are provided, as well as a specifically tailored test for differential expression in single-cell RNA sequencing data.
