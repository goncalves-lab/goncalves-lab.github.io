## The Somatic Evolution & Early Detection lab @ DKFZ
Our group aims to understand the processes of somatic and regulatory genome evolution during ageing and carcinogenesis. We combine experimental approaches with bioinformatic analyses and statistical modelling (20% experimental, 80% computational), with a long-term view of improving the early detection of cancer.

## Current projects
We are developing multiple projects that combine deep DNA and single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics with functional analysis and comparative genomics with the goal of understanding how the perturbation of genetic sequences can lead to the development of tumours. We also develop computational methods for novel technologies.

### Comparative genomics of carcinogenesis
Why do some organisms, including many humans, never develop cancer in their lifetime? To address this question, we are studying model organisms with high natural cancer resistance and exceptional longevity such as the naked mole-rat and Ansellâ€™s mole-rat.

### Comparative genomics of ageing
In humans, the female reproductive system plays a significant role in shaping life- and health- span. In our group we functionally model homeostasis and dysregulation of the female reproductive tract over ageing and upon hormonal perturbation in mouse models and in human, using high-throughput sequencing of single-cell experiments.

### Method development for single-cell data
The throughput of routine single-cell experiments is projected to reach a million cells by the beginning of 2023, which poses important computational challenges for the analysis of these datasets. To alleviate the issue we apply transport theory to develop lightweight non-parametric methods for the analysis of large single-cell experiments.
